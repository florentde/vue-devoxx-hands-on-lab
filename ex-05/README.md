# ex-05 Vue.js devtools

When the application is build for production, correct settings will be set and Vue.js devtools will not be available.

##Â Step 1
Install Vue.js devtools, it is a browser extension.

## Step 2

Explore components, this is very useful when using libraries of components, you can discover which props are available and set them to see what is happening.

Your app becomes an interactive documentation of sort.

## Step 3

Vuex store is available from the devtools, you can (now) edit it, but you can also see the whole history of states, therefore you can understand exactly the current state of your application and what lead to it.

It is also possible to replay events, you can go back in time and replay everything.

## Step 4

Explore the performance of your application, find out how much time a component took to load down to every step of the component life cycle.

Check where you fall below 60 frames per second. Find out what was happening at that moment in the app.
